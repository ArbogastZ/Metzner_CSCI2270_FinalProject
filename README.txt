Project Summary
One paragraph description of how the program works and what it does. How to Run This section contains instructions, with examples, of how to run your program.

This a Universal Grade Calculator, you can find out your current/final grade and things like the minimum grade you can get on your final to pass your class! You can calculate your grade, print your grades, find out your strength and weakness in the class, minimum grade on final to pass the class, and change any grades you just entered thus far...(adding grades coming soon). Nothing high tech here, it's a linked list of arrays in which you manually enter in you class grades to calculate your current grade since D2L doesn't do it for you (WHY??). When entering the number of grades in a section, make sure you only alot enough space in the array for grades you've actually earned, if you've earned 5 grades then alot 5 slots in the array. When it asks for a number only enter a number since it uses cin>>. Always include the final in the count of your finals even if you haven't taken it, the program accounts for it.

Dependencies 
This section contains a description of any dependencies that your program requires. For example, if your program relies on another third-party library that needs to be installed, you should provide a description of where to find that library and instructions for how to install it or a link to installation instructions.

The only libraries inluded are iostream and istream(getline). So if your compiler can't handle that, I'm sorry.

 
System Requirements
Is your program for Windows, Mac, Linux? Are there additional system requirements other than the operating system?

My program was built and run on Linux (Spring'16 Ubuntunu VM virtualbox).

Group Members

Contributors 
Parker for fixing the memory allocation problem related to my dynamic array/struct.

Open issues/bugs 
Bugs:
If it's asking for a number and you accidentally hit a letter, congrats you broke the program (I used cin>> instead of getline because I hate converting strings).
After changing a grade need to update values
Adding on:
I didn't have time to create a function to add new grades to a section... but then again what's the point if you can't 'save' your class to the computer which was my plan initially using s11n.
I would like the minimum grade to pass also be minimum grade needed for an A, B, C...etc.
Also some classes drop the lowest score or three in a particular section, I would like to add that capability eventually.
